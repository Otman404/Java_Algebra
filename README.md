# Matrix Calculations in Java

This repository contains :
- Matrix * Matrix
- Matrix + Matrix
- Matrix - Matrix
- Scalar * Matrix

And  to make the code more efficient and faster  I used threads to execute multiple operations at the same time.
and to make the job easier for testing I used files io to run tests on bigger matrices

### Input
Can be via console or via files
In Case you want to use files , just change the matrices already typed in Matrix1.txt and Matrix2.txt files
